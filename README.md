This is an EXTREMELY simple plugin to enable maintenance mode on a wordpress site.

The only customization is to add the site's logo.

This is my first plugin, but it is clean and I did not use any code that wasn't neccessary. I needed to be able to flip a switch for my clients so that we could do site migrations and maintenance work without sending visitors to a 404 or repeatedly redirecting them. We didn't need a lot of bells and whistles.

Thanks for checking this out and have a great day!
